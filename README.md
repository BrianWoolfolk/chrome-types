This contains code to parse Chrome's internal extensions definitions, to generate both a JS model and publish TypeScript definition files.

It helps generate two artifacts:

* It is used to generate types published at [chrome-types](https://npmjs.com/package/chrome-types)â€”if you want to bring in automatically-generated types for your extensions, start here

* Its library parts are published as [chrome-types-helpers](https://npmjs.com/package/chrome-types-helpers) for working with ".d.ts" files and friends
