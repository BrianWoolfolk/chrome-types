This is a repository for working with TypeScript definition files as part of Chrome Extensions.

This repo has a dual purpose:

* It is used to generate types published at [chrome-types](https://npmjs.com/package/chrome-types)â€”if you want to bring in automatically-generated types for your extensions, start here

* Its library parts are published as [chrome-types-helpers](https://npmjs.com/package/chrome-types-helpers) for working with ".d.ts" files and friends

# Notes

This README is a work-in-progress.
